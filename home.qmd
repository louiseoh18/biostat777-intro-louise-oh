## About 

I am a young biostatistician in training. I am pursuing my ScM in Biostatistics at <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/"><span style="color: #515897;"><b>Johns Hopkins School of Public Health</b></span></a>. I completed my Bachelor's degree at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/"><span style="color: #515897;"><b>Northwestern University</b></span></a> with a major in Statistics in minors in Data Science and Global Health Studies. 

I spend my free time Olympic Weightlifting, traveling, and spending time with my friends and family.
