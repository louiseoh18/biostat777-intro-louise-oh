## Technical Details

This website was built using **Quarto**, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.

* **Framework:** Quarto Website
* **Editing:** Built locally in RStudio and VSCode.
* **Analysis:** The `Example Analysis` page was rendered from a `.qmd` file, executing R code chunks.
* **Key R Packages Used:**
    * `tidyverse` (for `dplyr` and `tidyr` data wrangling)
    * `ggplot2` (for visualization)
    * `palmerpenguins` (for the dataset)
* **Deployment:** This site is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The `_quarto.yml` file is configured to output the rendered HTML to the `/docs` folder, which is set as the publishing source in the repository settings.
