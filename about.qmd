## Hobbies

I  dedicate most of my free time training for Olympic weightlifting and occasionally compete for fun. I also do CrossFit to get just enough cardio in to survive everyday life. 

I enjoy attending piano concertos and recitals. I played the piano until highschool with the hope of attending a conservatory (I did not). Still, I was especially excited to join an institution with a renowned music school like Peabody!
